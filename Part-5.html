<h1>George Square</h1>
<h2>Continue left and straight to George Square.</h2>

<p>
George Square now is what appears to be the main square and central point of the city. Laid out in 1781, it existed as part of the innovative grid system that Glasgow uses to lay out its streets &ndash; something New York was rumoured to copy.
It isn't actually the centre of the city though. All distances are measured from the Glasgow Cross which is almost 2 miles over there, and the true geographical centre of the city is Blythswood square, half a mile that way.
On the South side of the square is the former General Post Office. West side, features the Merchants House building and here on the east side is the Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council
The North side consists of Queen Street Station, the second main station in Glasgow. This serves all northern suburbs in Glasgow and is the main connection of trains to Edinburgh, with many going back and forth each day.</p>
