<h1>Buchanan Street</h1>
<h2>Leave the lighthouse but continue down mitchell lane to get to Buchanan Street - go left and stop outside Willow Tea Rooms.</h2>

<p>
Rent costs as much on Buchanan Street as &pound;250 per square foot, making it the 6th most expensive street in the United Kingdom for retail rent, only surpassed by 5 streets in London. Buchanan Street is also the second busiest shopping thoroughfare, second only to Oxford Street in London. Glasgow has been recognised for being the second best shopping destination in the United Kingdom, after London, but I would of course disagree (its the first!).
Charles Rennie Mackintosh is one of Glasgows greatest exports. He was a architect, designer and artist who has a large influence on European Design. His influence can be seen all over the city in many buildings, including two tearooms, one of which is this one here - the other has recently been refurbished back to original plans.</p>
