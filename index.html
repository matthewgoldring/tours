<h1>Matthew's Glasgow Walking Tour!!</h1>
<h2>Welcome, I hope you have a great time and learn lots of interesting things about the best city in the world! All tours begin at Central station.</h2>

<p>
Thanks for going on this tour! I love Glasgow and am so pleased that I am able to share it with you. Enjoy the tour, it is hard to get lost! And if you do, just ask any friendly local person and they would be happy to help you out!

Eventually you will be given options on what route you wish to take. Just follow the links on each page, and I will let you know what ones you may have missed at the end. 

This tour is free of charge, but if you have enjoyed it, please feel free to do a good deed afterwards. Maybe buy a homeless person some lunch? Or make a small donation to charity? Thanks for making a difference!

ENJOY THE TOUR!!
