<h1>Central Station</h1>
<u>A great place to begin the tour is also a popular meeting point for Glaswegians - under the clock at central station.</u>
<br>
<b>Towards the back of the station</b>
<p>The Grand Central Hotel, was one of Glasgow's most prestigious hotels in its heyday, hosting residents as famous as John F Kennedy, Frank Sinatra and Winston Churchill.<br>
The hotel was completed in 1883, and is most famous for receiving the world's first long-distance television pictures, transmitted from London on the 24th May 1927 by John Logie Baird.<br>
After years of changing hands followed by financial problems the hotel closed in 2009 amid concerns of asbestos contamination and structural deterioration, but was repaired, refurbished and rebranded, re-opening again in 2010. It is now a popular venue for weddings, and has a great bar that overlooks the busy station inside.</p>
	
<p>Glasgow Central is one of two main-line railway terminals in Glasgow. This station opened in Summer 1879 and currently serves all of Glasgow's Southern suburbs and towns and is the main terminus to connect to England.<br>
It has an estimated 32 million passenger entries and exits each year, making it the UK's 11th busiest railway station (much more then Edinburgh - 20th busiest)<br>
It consists of two parts, the upper and lower level &ndash; the lower being a separate station until 1886 &ndash; and has since together gone through several periods of expansion and rebuilding.<br>
The station is protected as a category A listed building and has a few distinguishing features such as the clock - a popular meeting point, the bridge over Argyll street which we may see later, and its spectacular glass roof.</p>
	
<p><b>Walk out the Union street exit (down the steps beside burger king). Cross the road to the left and take the first right down Gordon Street, and first right again down Mitchell street. Stop outside Oddbins.</b>
This building (point up) is known as the Lighthouse. Designed by Charles Rennie Makintosh in 1895 it served for a long time as the offices of the Glasgow Herald Newspaper. Today it is a centre for design and architecture, and has a great viewing platform of the city of Glasgow on the 3rd floor, as well as excellent exhibitions and museums.</p>
	
<p><b>Leave the lighthouse but continue down mitchell lane to get to Buchanan Street - go left and stop outside Willow Tea Rooms.</b>
Rent costs as much on Buchanan Street as &pound;250 per square foot, making it the 6th most expensive street in the United Kingdom for retail rent, only surpassed by 5 streets in London. Buchanan Street is also the second busiest shopping thoroughfare, second only to Oxford Street in London. Glasgow has been recognised for being the second best shopping destination in the United Kingdom, after London, but I would of course disagree (its the first!).
Charles Rennie Mackintosh is one of Glasgows greatest exports. He was a architect, designer and artist who has a large influence on European Design. His influence can be seen all over the city in many buildings, including two tearooms, one of which is this one here - the other has recently been refurbished back to original plans.</p>
<p><b>Turn right down Exchange place, past the GOMA and stop at the duke of wellington Statue.</b>
Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington was best known for defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo (as well as giving his name to the wellington boot) and statues honouring this military hero can be found all across Britain. The Glasgow version was designed by Italian sculptor Carlo Marochetti and was erected in 1844. For the best part of 140 years, the statue stood without much fanfare. That all changed in the early 1980s, when a traffic cone mysteriously started appearing on top of the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s head. The story goes that one night, a clever Ned (oxymoron) climbed up and put a cone on his head. Horrified, the police spent their time removing it (because they have nothing better to do?!). The following night, a ned (maybe even the same one), climbed up and put a NEW cone on his head. So the police, took the time to remove it once again, but of course, it wasn't off for long as a new one appeared again. This back and forth went on for a while, and eventually, despite council intervention and counter protests, it was declared that the cone could stay - yahoo!&nbsp;It shows the city's sense of humour and its light-hearted attitude to authority.</p>
<p><b>Continue left and straight to george square.</b>
George Square now is what appears to be the main square and central point of the city. Laid out in 1781, it existed as part of the innovative grid system that Glasgow uses to lay out its streets &ndash; something New York was rumoured to copy.
It isn't actually the centre of the city though. All distances are measured from the Glasgow Cross which is almost 2 miles over there, and the true geographical centre of the city is Blythswood square, half a mile that way.
On the South side of the square is the former General Post Office. West side, features the Merchants House building and here on the east side is the Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council
The North side consists of Queen Street Station, the second main station in Glasgow. This serves all northern suburbs in Glasgow and is the main connection of trains to Edinburgh, with many going back and forth each day.</p>

*** my&nbsp;tour&nbsp;ends here, but go right at the chambers and left onto Ingram Street into Merchant City. From here it is good to take small diversions down different streets. For a longer&nbsp;tour, turn left down the High Street towards St Mungos and the cathedral , circling round back to Buchanan street. The Subway to West End.
