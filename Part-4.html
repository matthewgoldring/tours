<h1>Cone Heed</h1>
<h2>Turn right down Exchange place, past the GOMA and stop at the duke of wellington Statue.</h2>

<p>
Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington was best known for defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo (as well as giving his name to the wellington boot) and statues honouring this military hero can be found all across Britain. The Glasgow version was designed by Italian sculptor Carlo Marochetti and was erected in 1844. For the best part of 140 years, the statue stood without much fanfare. That all changed in the early 1980s, when a traffic cone mysteriously started appearing on top of the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s head. The story goes that one night, a clever Ned (oxymoron) climbed up and put a cone on his head. Horrified, the police spent their time removing it (because they have nothing better to do?!). The following night, a ned (maybe even the same one), climbed up and put a NEW cone on his head. So the police, took the time to remove it once again, but of course, it wasn't off for long as a new one appeared again. This back and forth went on for a while, and eventually, despite council intervention and counter protests, it was declared that the cone could stay - yahoo!&nbsp;It shows the city's sense of humour and its light-hearted attitude to authority.</p>
