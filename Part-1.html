<h1>Central Station</h1>
<h2>A great place to begin the tour is also a popular meeting point for Glaswegians - under the clock at central station.</h2>
<p><b>Towards the back of the station</b>
The Grand Central Hotel, was one of Glasgow's most prestigious hotels in its heyday, hosting residents as famous as John F Kennedy, Frank Sinatra and Winston Churchill.<br>
The hotel was completed in 1883, and is most famous for receiving the world's first long-distance television pictures, transmitted from London on the 24th May 1927 by John Logie Baird.<br>
After years of changing hands followed by financial problems the hotel closed in 2009 amid concerns of asbestos contamination and structural deterioration, but was repaired, refurbished and rebranded, re-opening again in 2010. It is now a popular venue for weddings, and has a great bar that overlooks the busy station inside.</p>
	
<p>Glasgow Central is one of two main-line railway terminals in Glasgow. This station opened in Summer 1879 and currently serves all of Glasgow's Southern suburbs and towns and is the main terminus to connect to England.<br>
It has an estimated 32 million passenger entries and exits each year, making it the UK's 11th busiest railway station (much more then Edinburgh - 20th busiest)<br>
It consists of two parts, the upper and lower level &ndash; the lower being a separate station until 1886 &ndash; and has since together gone through several periods of expansion and rebuilding.<br>
The station is protected as a category A listed building and has a few distinguishing features such as the clock - a popular meeting point, the bridge over Argyll street which we may see later, and its spectacular glass roof.</p>
