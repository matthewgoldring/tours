This building is known as the Lighthouse. Designed by Charles Rennie Makintosh in 1895 it served for a long time as the offices of the Glasgow Herald Newspaper. Today it is a centre for design and architecture, and has a great viewing platform of the city of Glasgow on the 3rd floor, as well as excellent exhibitions and museums. <b>Enter the lighthouse to view this excellent museum and viewing platform on the 3rd floor.</p>
